# Vulnerability Scanner Dashboard

Welcome to the **Vulnerability Scanner Dashboard**! This is a fun React app you can run in VS Code to scan networks, find vulnerabilities, and see cool charts and a 3D map. It’s like a detective tool for checking websites or networks!

## What’s Inside?

- A dashboard to start scans and see results.
- Tools like Nmap, Nslookup, WhatWeb, Dirb, Gobuster, and DNS Recon.
- Awesome charts (pies and lines) for vulnerabilities.
- A 3D network map to see your scan in action.
- Dark mode for a comfy coding vibe.

## Dependencies (The Building Blocks)

These are the packages we need:

- **React**: Builds the app.
- **three**: Makes the 3D map.
- **framer-motion**: Adds smooth animations.
- **recharts**: Draws charts.
- **lucide-react**: Gives us icons (like shields!).
- **tailwindcss**: Makes styling easy.
- **postcss & autoprefixer**: Helps Tailwind work.
